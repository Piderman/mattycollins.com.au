I was shortlisted in B&T 30 under 30 this year! Oh shit waddup.
<!-- /intro -->

I entered B&Ts 30 under 30 and made it into the [shortlist for tech](http://www.bandt.com.au/advertising/rejoice-bts-30-30-shortlist-2017).
The event was held at the Ivy in Sydney and I got a sweet work trip out of it, working from isobar's Sydney office for two days. People were on the whole rather stylish up there (lots of blazers with jeans) and I went full-tourist, taking as many bridge/opera house photos as I could.

I thought I'd take this achievement as an opportunity to reflect on my career and what it means to&mdash;holy shit have I really not touched my site since [June 2016](https://github.com/Piderman/mattycollins.com.au/graphs/commit-activity)!!!

And the last post before this was back in [2014]({% post_url 2014-10-28-this-is-not-normal %}) you say? Really? Damn.

something lead into success/smart

## Well..
I came across the following issues when writing this post...

- forgotten the credentials for deploying this site
- couldn't make a new post because `rake post` was missing a dependency
- _still_ couldn't make a new post because `rake post` had been using the wrong output folder since updating jekyll
- noticed nested lists weren't indented
- noticed none of my blog post would load from the blog list as they didnt have `.html` in the link address

I make websites for a living...in exchange for money. I got this.

It's not all success and amazing things. People don't typically broadcast the shitty moments.
