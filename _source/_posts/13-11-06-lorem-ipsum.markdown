I don't always use <q>lorem ipsum</q>, but when I do it's futurama quotes.

With thanks to [fillerama](http://chrisvalleskey.com/fillerama/), my testing content is both piratical and amusing!

Your best is an idiot! I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike.
As though! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

## The Cryonic Woman

I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. You're going to do his laundry? Hey, whatcha watching? You know, I was God once. One hundred dollars. Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

* Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!
* I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!
* Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

### The Luck of the Fryrish
Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. No, just a regular mistake. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. When will that be? You are the last hope of the universe.

#### That Darn Katz!
Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. They're like sex, except I'm having them!

1. Belligerent and numerous.
2. I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.
3. Shut up and get to the point!

##### Brannigan, Begin Again
And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Why would I want to know that?
