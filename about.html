title : About Me
---
<p>I'm Matty, a frond-end developer from Melbourne, Australia. My spirit animal is a giraffe (clearly), I have <del>blue hair</del> <ins>blue hair with a mohawk</ins>, ride a hipster banana board and listen to pop-punk or chiptunes.</p>


<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>I completed a degree in Games and Interactivity (Arts) in 2010, with subjects scattered across the history of media in Australia, 3D modeling and animation, game design, and web development. I have always been involved in web, starting with table table layouts and Frontpage. Like most people, I got into web because my band needed a website</p>



<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I started off as a wee junior front-end developer at <a href="http://mintleaf.com.au">Mintleaf Studio</a> and quickly weaseled my way up to lead developer on some large projects when we expanded into a new studio <a href="http://websilk.com.au">Websilk</a>. I know lead mobile design and development and dabble in accessibility.</p>

<p>We use .Net and the beast that is Visual Studio, I don't mean to hate on it but it was <strong>not</strong> made for CSS.</p>

<h2>Play</h2>
<p>My name is Matty and I'm a PC gamer. I love me some games, nothing much can compare with online <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr>'s like Battlefield. I have an Xbox controller hooked up for action / adventure games (Assassins Creed, Darksiders). We recently moved house to which I found my old N64 in a box complete with working controllers, Zelda, Goldeneye, Mario and Mario Kart, awesome.</p>

<p>I also play bass guitar, not as much as I'd like too these days but I still enjoy a good session.</p>
