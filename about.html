	<h2>Preface</h2>
	<p>I completed a degree in Games and Interactivity (Arts) in 2010, with subjects scattered across the history of media in Australia, 3D modeling and animation, game design, and web development. I have dabbled in web for a long time, starting with table layouts and Frontpage and like most people, I got into web because my band needed a website. But I really took to it after learning about semantics and what you can do with CSS.</p>

	<h2>Work</h2>
	<p>I started out as a wee front-end developer at <a href="http://mintleaf.com.au">Mintleaf Studio</a> stumbling around a CMS I had never used and editing CSS I barely understood. I quickly weaseled my way up to lead developer on some large projects when we expanded into a new studio <a href="http://websilk.com.au">Websilk</a>. I now lead mobile development as well as being the go-to guy for accessibility. We use .Net and the beast that is Visual Studio, I don't mean to hate on it but it was <strong>not</strong> made for CSS.</p>

	<h2>Play</h2>
	<p>I am a gamer (hence the degree) and nothing much can compare with online <abbr title="First Person Shooter">FPS</abbr>'s like Battlefield. I have an Xbox controller hooked up for action / adventure games (Assassins Creed, Darksiders). We recently moved house to which I found my old N64 in a box complete with working controllers, Zelda, Goldeneye, Mario and Mario Kart, awesome.</p>

	<p>I also play bass guitar, not as much as I'd like to these days but I still enjoy a good session.</p>
