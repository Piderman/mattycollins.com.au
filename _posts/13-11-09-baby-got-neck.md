Three little words that are hard to say: <q>I am done</q>. With them they bring pain, humiliation and the certainty that the project will instantly return with 20 more bugs to address.
<!-- /intro -->
#### Three strikes and you're out
We have a running joke at work in that we can only say we are done, or any variation of the word, on site three times. Claiming we are finished seems to curse the site and summon more bugs or worse, features from the client. There is so much to do in the final polishing stages of a build and without another set of eyes, it is easy to overlook and miss small things. Its cliché but <q>the last 10% is really 90%</q>, and hey, clichés work for a reason.

## The site
This site had an interesting past, looking back over two years this site has seen the following with only a splash page being produced.

* initial design in early 2011 shortly after starting work at Mintleaf
* a redesign before any code had been writing
* abandoning Wordpress for Octopress
* ditching Octopress for Jekyll
* another design

Back in September a new design was made and shortly after code was being smashed on a [new branch](https://github.com/Piderman/mattycollins.com.au/tree/bravo). The new design this time was fantastic motivation for committing myself to actually finish what i started, and two months (ish) later here we are!

There is a [behind the scenes]({% post_url 13-09-29-content-and-color %}) series of posts about for those interested which details the progress and failures of the site.

## It's never really done
Websites are constantly changing and growing things. I have a lot planned for this site and look forward to implement new features and exploring Jeykll in the new future.
