During the design of the site, I wanted to focus two main things: typography and color.
<!-- /intro -->




## Content
Being a sucker for mobile first development, it made sense that content should be the starting point of the re-design. I had the good fortune of having three to four posts left over from the previous site so I had real content to design around, with the exception of [this page](/blerg/the-making-of/lorem-ipsum) to cover any missed options. <ins>At the time of writing, turns out I have forgotten <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>'s, my bad</ins>


I tried something new when designing this site by paying close attention to how the content was going to be viewed. [Trent Walton's post](http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/) on Fluid type helped me greatly as the basis for me grids, the sidebar *should* be just shy of the 75 character mark, and the text is sized across various screens appropriately to meet this line length mark. This way of thinking flowed through in development, as it forced me to think in terms of <code>em</code>'s rather than <code>px</code>. I capped my content sections at <code>36em</code>, that way even if a grid spanned say 60% of the screen, the text inside would still be nice a readable.

## Color
Ms [Laura Kalbag](http://laurakalbag.com/) was a massive influence on using color in design.
