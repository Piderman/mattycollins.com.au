According to GitHub, this site should have been launched at the end of June, a <q>good</q> three months ago with zero progess. Time to wipe the dust of my keyboard.
<!-- /intro -->

Three months is a long time to not be doing something you love. I'd like to say that it's been a result of [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/) taking up most of my spare time (although that game <em>is</em> brilliant), but unfortunately it has been something less fun.

I was getting crushed by deadlines and workloads, back-to-back projects and pressure definitely got the better of me. When I wasn't at work (even at work actually) I wasn't reading up on the web as I used to. I'm not sure if it was the projects I was working on or what, but something changed and it seemed I had stopped practicing what I loved.

It's been way too long, time to get back into it.
