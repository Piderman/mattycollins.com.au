I hear this <q>social media</q> thing is going to take off&hellip;
<!-- /intro -->
## Enhance
Minor update[^1] for the site, it now has/uses Disqus for all your commenting[^2] needs!

I am using this [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) although it is somewhat redundant as its only a one-man-project, it is still good to learn and helps to understand git on a mental level.

I am dumbing it down a bit as this "feature" came  straight off the master, I don't have a development branch or see the need for one on such a small project. In the future though the development branch would come in handy for something such as overhauling the SMACSS or implementing two post types in Jekyll. Who knows?
