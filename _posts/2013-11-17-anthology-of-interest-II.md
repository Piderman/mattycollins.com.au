For this redesign, I opted with a much more modern approach to design with the majority of it being done in the browser.
<!-- /intro -->

## The deliverable(s)
Typically, high fidelity compsitions of every page of a site will be designed, shown to the client, reviewed and approved before the development process starts. A massive advantage of being my own client (one of the few perks) meant I could adopt a more agile approach.

At the end of my design phase only two designs were produced: the home page and a style-tile[^1] inspired internal page. Design only focused on typography, blocking the layout and component basics such as the sidebar. Everything else however was done right then and there in the browser.

## In browser advatages
There's so much that a static design f

needed quicker feedback in the correct medium the site would finish in

I really enjoyed nailing down the concept of "what a heading looks like"

[^1]: [style tiles](http://styletil.es/), a visual web design process for clients and the responsive web

##### ramblings
Static PS comps can only do so much...

grid logic is better communicated in a fluid form
