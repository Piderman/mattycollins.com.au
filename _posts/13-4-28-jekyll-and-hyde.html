<p class="intro">It's not you Octopress, it's me.</p>
<p>My site is now running on Jekyll after the decision to leave WordPress and databases behind. My goal was to use the awesome <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> but alas, I failed. I took it down a notch and stuck with the engine Octopress runs off &ndash; Jekyll.</p>
<!-- /intro -->

<p>It was a very bumpy start with Git and Octopress, not sure how I managed to do it but, I broke my site bad and couldn't get it to roll back to the previous commit. Unfortunately I spent a whole weekend trying to get Octopress up but had to write it off. I simply didn't understand it enough with the themes and structure, then I couldn't configure my SASS build engine to work how Octopress wanted, Windows and Ruby was getting over my head, <span class="toUpper">Urgh</span>!</p>

<p>So I dropped the site back down to using Jekyll, it has been a great switch so far. Giraffe <del>v2</del> <ins>v4</ins> could be upgraded to Octopress, but for now I see no reason to move. &lt;3</p>
