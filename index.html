		<p>&hellip;Seriously, just see me run</p>
		<p>I am the lead developer working at <a href="http://mintleafstudio.com.au" target="_blank">Mintleaf</a> and I pride myself on building device agnostic sites with modern best practices.</p>
		<p>I love CSS, semantic HTML, standards-driven development, accessibility, the mobile web and of course using buzzwords.</p>
		
		<p>I believe I'm up to my <del>second, third</del> <ins>fourth</ins> re-design of this site. I am pushing myself on this project to: use git for version control, use a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that is new to me ( Jekyll ), and use SMACSS and BEM for scalable development.
