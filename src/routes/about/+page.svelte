<p>
	I am a senior developer with over 10 years experience building accessible websites and web apps.
	Specialising in front-end development I have been focusing on Jamstackfor the past few years.
</p>

<p>
	I completed a degree in Games and Interactivity (Arts) in 2010, with subjects scattered across the
	history of media in Australia, 3D modeling and animation, game design, and web development. I have
	dabbled in web for a long time, starting with table layouts and Frontpage and like most people, I
	got into web because my band needed a website. But I really took to it after learning about
	semantics and what you can do with CSS.
