I am a senior developer with over 10 years experience building accessible websites and web apps. Specialising in front-end development I have been focusing on Jamstackfor the past few years.

I completed a degree in Games and Interactivity (Arts) in 2010, with subjects scattered across the history of media in Australia, 3D modeling and animation, game design, and web development. I have dabbled in web for a long time, starting with table layouts and Frontpage and like most people, I got into web because my band needed a website. But I really took to it after learning about semantics and what you can do with CSS.
